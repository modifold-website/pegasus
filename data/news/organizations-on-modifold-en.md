Hey everyone! Today we’re shipping **Organizations on Modifold**.

This update is for creators who build together and want one shared place to manage access, ownership, and project publishing.

## TL;DR

- Create organizations with name, summary, and icon
- Invite members by **user slug** via notifications
- Assign member roles and permissions for projects and organization actions
- Attach projects to organizations so they publish under team identity
- Public sees approved projects, members can also see attached drafts

## Why we built this

Until now, Modifold did not have built-in shared ownership. If you had a team, permissions were harder to keep clean and consistent across multiple projects.

Organizations fix that with a dedicated team layer: invite members, define access, and keep management in one place.

## Creating and managing organizations

You can now create an organization, upload an icon, set a summary, and manage everything from organization settings.

Members can be invited by slug and accept or decline directly from notifications.

## Projects under organization identity

Projects can now be attached to an organization and shown as organization-owned projects.

This is especially useful for teams, studios, and long-term multi-maintainer projects.

## Visibility rules

For public visitors, organization pages show only approved projects.

For signed-in organization members, attached drafts are visible too, so teams can manage unpublished work safely.

## For solo creators

Nothing breaks for solo workflows. Organizations are optional, and you can adopt them only when your project grows into a team effort.

We’ll keep iterating based on your feedback. Thanks for building with us.

Today we are officially moving Modifold out of Beta and into a full release.

Over the past weeks we received a lot of valuable feedback and bug reports. Many of those issues were fixed quickly, and your reports helped us improve stability and the overall experience.

## A 6-language interface
One of the biggest milestones is that the Modifold interface is now available in six languages:

- English (default)
- Spanish
- Portuguese
- Russian
- Turkish
- Ukrainian

When you visit the site, the language is chosen based on your browser language. If you want to switch to another language (for example, your browser is in English but you want the interface in Spanish), you can change it in your Modifold profile settings.

Translations may be inaccurate in some places. If you speak any of these languages and notice a translation issue, we would really appreciate your help. Please message us on X (DMs) with the incorrect text and your suggested correction.

## Profile verification
We also introduced profile verification. In your account settings there is a new tab called "Verification" where you can submit a verification request.

Verification does not provide extra platform privileges. It only adds a badge next to your profile name. The badge helps distinguish verified and well-known modders.

Current requirements:

- 500+ followers on X or YouTube, or
- 3,000+ downloads on CurseForge

To help moderators verify ownership, you must include at least one link (X, YouTube, or CurseForge) where your Modifold profile link is present.

We may change these requirements in the future and raise them. Our goal is to keep verification meaningful: it should highlight established authors without turning into a badge that everyone has by default.

## Project comments
Another major feature is comments on projects. Logged-in users can now leave feedback, constructive criticism, or questions under your mod.

All new comments are moderated by the Modifold team to prevent rule violations, such as insults or spam. The project author can also delete or hide a comment so other users do not see it.

If you do not want your project to be commentable, there is a toggle in the project settings to enable or disable comments. Comments are enabled by default for all projects. If you disable them, all existing comments will be hidden and the "Comments" tab will disappear from the project page.

In upcoming updates we want to add comment editing, because we consider it a necessary feature. Please do not use comments to harm others. Keep it constructive; otherwise the comment may be removed, and accounts may be restricted or banned in the future.

## Thank you
We value every new author on Modifold and we are happy to see your interest in the platform. We hope we can keep pushing the Hytale modding community forward together.

We would be grateful if you share Modifold or mention it on social media, show the platform to friends, or recommend it to popular modders.

There is a lot ahead. We are currently forming our update roadmap while continuing to ship improvements: bug fixes, new creator features, and upgrades or redesigns of existing parts of the platform.

# Overview

We've been following the game's release for a really long time and want to be right there with the community from day one! Modifold is a platform made by fans for fans. Here people upload their mods, others download them, leave feedback, share ideas and help each other make even better content.

We want to support mod creators, help everyone find great work and grow together. The project is fully open-source (AGPL-3.0 license), and we really hope for your help so Modifold becomes a convenient and awesome place for everyone!

# Contributing

We would be super happy to see any fixes, refactoring, new features or even small improvements to the current code! Even a tiny pull request can make a big difference: bug fix, optimization, better interface or translation.

We try to stay as open and transparent as possible, and we really count on the community's help to develop the site. Together we can make Modifold fast, convenient and good-looking!

Under AGPL-3.0 all changes and derivative works also have to stay open, which helps everyone grow together and protects the project.

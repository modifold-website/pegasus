Dear Hytale Community,

The wait for Hytale has been long, and we want to be right there with you from day one! Today, we are excited to announce that **Modifold is officially in Beta.** Modifold is more than just a website; it’s a platform made by fans, for fans. It is a place where creators can upload their mods and players can discover new ways to experience the game. As a "young platform," we are just starting our journey, and we invite you to help us shape the future of Hytale modding.

### Why Beta?
We are actively testing and refining every part of the site. Launching in Beta means we already have a solid foundation and now move into a more feature-complete testing phase together with the community. You might still encounter some bugs or see features evolve, but your feedback at this stage is what will make Modifold truly convenient and awesome for everyone.

### How You Can Help
Since we are in the early public stage of development, your input remains extremely valuable:
- Share your mods: Start building your profile and show the world what you're working on.
- Report bugs: Found something broken? Let us know so we can fix it.
- Suggest features: Have an idea for a "cool" addition to the site? We’re all ears.

The heart of our community is our Discord server. It’s the fastest way to get updates, report issues, or just chat with fellow Hytale enthusiasts.

Best regards,  
The Modifold Team
